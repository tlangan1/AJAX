<h1 align="center"> Fetch and XHR APIs</h1>

Fetch and XMLHttpRequest (otherwise known as XHR) are JavaScript APIs provided by browsers to automate server requests. Fetch is the newer and more robust option.

readyState Holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest. Changes from 0 to 4:  
0: request not initialized  
1: server connection established  
2: request received  
3: processing request  
4: request finished and response is ready
